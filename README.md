# Quiz Application
Created a very basic quiz application. The data got pulled from the local data.json. Array of questions with answers and the correct index of the correct answer are in data.json. Using check button we can check whether the selected answer is the correct answer. Next and Prev button can be used to move to next and previous question respectively.
